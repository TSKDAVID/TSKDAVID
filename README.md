hey there! ðŸ‘‹

i'm really into anything related to computer science, computer technology, and programming. currently, i'm working on this cool project for my client that automates book creation and offers. so whenever my client gets a message, the program jumps into action, generating an offer with the book included as a PDF. pretty neat, right?

as for my background, i'm studying at the University of JaÃ©n in Spain on an Erasmus scholarship. before that, i was diving into computer science and technology back in my home university in Georgia. the name's a bit of a tongue-twister, so let's save that for later, shall we?

now, when it comes to skills, i've got a knack for programming and some serious problem-solving chops. i'm all about adaptability, multitasking, and typing faster than you can say "keyboard." i'm into pretty much everything at this point â€“ i love diving deep into different subjects and mastering them.

when i'm not coding up a storm, you can find me on the badminton court, hitting some tennis balls, or challenging friends to a game of table tennis. i'm also a big movie buff â€“ give me a good film, and i'm all set.

coding isn't just my job â€“ it's my hobby too. i'm always looking for new challenges and projects to sink my teeth into.

that's me in a nutshell! if you've got any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. i'm always up for a good conversation. ðŸ˜Š
