hey there! ðŸ‘‹

i'm really into anything related to computer science, computer technology, and programming.

as for my background, i'm studying at the University of JaÃ©n in Spain on an Erasmus scholarship. before that, i was diving into computer science and technology back in my home university in Georgia.

now, when it comes to skills, i've got a knack for programming and some serious problem-solving skills. i'm all about adaptability, multitasking, i'm into pretty much everything at this point â€“ i love diving deep into different subjects and mastering them.

when i'm not coding up a storm, you can find me on the badminton court, hitting some tennis balls, or challenging friends to a game of table tennis. i'm also a big movie buff.

coding isn't just my job â€“ it's my hobby too. i'm always looking for new challenges and projects to sink my teeth into.

that's me in a nutshell! if you've got any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. i'm always up for a good conversation. ðŸ˜Š
